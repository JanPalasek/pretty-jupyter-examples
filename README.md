# Pretty Jupyter Examples

Shows, how Pretty Jupyter can be used by using examples. It is recommended to just clone it and watch the generated HTML document and compare it with the ipynb source.

```sh
python -m venv "venv"
source venv/bin/activate # powershell ./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
python -m pip install pretty-jupyter
```
